Development Plan (TODO file)
----------------------------

Short-term goals:

  #. Add support for convolution of frequency-defined elements 
  
Longer term goals and other tasks to be done at some time:

  * Add netlist variable sweep in DC analysis
  
  * Implement time-step control in transient analysis

  * Implement Harmonic Balance analysis (or equivalent)

  * Add "+" notation for multiple lines in parser 
  
  * Implement sparse-matrix-based AC analysis

  * Handle RuntimeWarnings more gracefully. Currently all
    RuntimeWarnings are suppressed when the AD tapes are being
    cleated/evaluated as sometimes function arguments are invalid.

Housekeeping and refinement:

  * Check for repeated terminals in subcircuit external connections.
    Should the following be allowed or not?::
