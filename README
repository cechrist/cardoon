Introduction
------------

Cardoon is a circuit simulator program being developed using
Python. The design was originally inspired from several ideas in
fREEDA (http://www.freeda.org/) and carrot
(http://vision.lakeheadu.ca/research.html), plus some improvements
that take advantage of the flexibility in Python.

One of the main goals of this project is to obtain a program which is
easy to modify and test to experiment new simulation
algorithms/models. Following good software engineering practices, the
program and the documentation are being developed at the same
time. Thus all implemented features are documented. Complete
documentation for this project is included with the source and can
also be found at:

A secondary objective is to add features and make the program
efficient enough to be useful for general use, if possible. The
program has already enough functionality to be useful for some
tasks. Currently basic DC/AC/Transient analyses have been
implemented. DC and Transient can use sparse or dense matrices. It can
currently simulate circuits with a few thousand nodes in reasonable
times. As of June 2012, Cardoon is probably the fastest available
Python-based circuit simulator. The program takes approximately 1.7
times the ngspice time to run a transient analysis of the soliton line
circuit (3022 nodes), which is quite good considering it is running on
an interpreter.

The device library includes basic components and several non-trivial
nonlinear models such as Gummel-Poon model for BJTs, EKV 2.6 and
BSIM3v3 for MOSFETs (there is also a memristor model).  Most of the
device models interface should be reasonably stable by now, but some
changes may happen for frequency-defined devices as they become better
supported by the analyses. The noise interface is not being used yet
and may change significantly.

It is likely easier to implement a new device model in Cardoon than it
is on most other simulators. Perhaps the main reason for this is due
to the Python language: the code tends to be more compact and it is
easier to debug and test modifications.  As with other simulators,
nonlinear models can use automatic differentiation for Jacobian
calculation, thus there is no need to write code for the
derivatives. In cardoon, the automatic differentiation library is also
used to speed up the evaluation of nonlinear equations.  Due to the
dynamic nature of the Python language automatic differentiation could
also be used to calculate sensitivities without any modification in
the device model code.  Another design feature is that electro-thermal
models (*i.e.*, with an additional thermal port) can be automatically
generated from temperature-dependent electrical models.

Cardoon is being developed with Python 2.6 on Debian Squeeze, but it
should work OK with Python 2.7 under other operating systems.
