The tests contained in this directory should be run after making
modifications to the program to ensure that there are no
regressions. All tests must be successful before committing changes to
the main repository.  Ideally, every time that a new feature is added
to the simulator, a netlist testing the feature and the corresponding
results should be added to this directory.

In order to run the tests, a set of reference result files
(``*_ref.npz``) is used by the test script to verify that the results
produced by the netlists match. These results are not available in the
main repository, but they can be downloaded from:

     http://vision.lakeheadu.ca/cardoon/reference_results.tar.gz

To test an individual netlist::

   ../cardoon.py -x run_tests.py <netlist name>

To perform all automated tests, run the following::

   ../cardoon.py -x run_tests.py *.net
